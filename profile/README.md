## Somleng

Somleng is the world's only Open Source Telco-as-a-service (TaaS) and Cloud-communications-as-a-service (CPaaS).
With the support of UNICEF, we're helping to save lives by reaching some of the most remote and vulnerable communities around the world.

> Our vision is a world where communications is accessible to everyone.
